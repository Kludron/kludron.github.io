## What is this blog about?

This blog was designed with the intention of teaching those who might've heard a bit about Cyber Security and want to know more about it,
or want to, in general, become more educated in the topic to better protect themselves online. The resources / blogs here are intentional to be 
helpful for those that might not know much about these topics, as well as introduce new topics to those who might already know stuff about 
Cyber Security.

## Why Lukewarm Security?

I'm always learning more and more about Cyber Security. The content on here explains some of the topics that I know about / have done research
into, but I'm still relatively new to this space. Because I'm still new, and learning more and more about this, I don't claim to be an expert
or a seasoned professional (hence it not being *hot*), yet I have had experience working in the field and education (hence it not being *cold*)
love to share what I've learnt with others.

## Who am I?

I'm an IT Engineer at a company called [Internet 2.0](https://internet2-0.com), studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of New
South Wales (UNSW) in Australia.

I'm passionate about [Security](/categories/security), Coding and Sharing what I've learnt with others.
