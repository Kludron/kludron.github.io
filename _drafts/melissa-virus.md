# Malware Throughout History: The Melissa Virus
## What is a computer virus?
Computer viruses, similar to biological viruses, are designed to replicate itself across the machine by modifying certain programs and inserting code. It’s purpose is to infect and alter the way your computer operates (typically malicious), whether that be to log and harvest credentials, spam your screen with ads, or to encrypt your computer and make it unusable.
Briefly, one of the differences between viruses and worms is how they infect a target system. Viruses are typically executables that require system activation before being run. Worms, however, do not require activation and typically spread via a connected network.

## What is The Melissa Virus and how did it work?
The Melissa Virus, named after a stripper in Florida, begun it’s journey on an Internet newsgroup, posted by a hijacked AOL (America Online) account. The post, promising free passwords to adult websites, contained Microsoft macro’s that, when opened by Microsoft Word, took control of the victims Microsoft Outlook account, and forwarded a phishing email containing the virus to the first 50 people in their address book.
The virus itself was termed as a ‘mass-mailing macro’ virus that, due to the mass number of emails it sent, caused networks to crash. While the virus was not created to steal information, money or break the victims computer, it cost approximately $80 million USD for cleanup and repair of infected systems. The overloading on the network from each victim sending 50 additional emails took down networks. At the time, the Melissa Virus had spread more rapidly than any other virus in history.

## Who created it?
The virus was created by David Lee Smith, and released on March 26th in 1999. After a joint effort between multiple federal agencies, David was caught less than a week later on April 1 1999 and sentenced (in 2002) to 20 months in federal prison and $5000 USD.
