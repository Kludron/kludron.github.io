## How to stay more private online.

**Posting when you get back home**
: This tip ties in with security. When you see someone post an image of them overseas on a holiday, one 
would typically assume that they're overseas on a holiday. But what does that mean for someone with 
potentially malicious intent? You're not at home, and probably won't be for a while.

**Using privacy-focused software**
: Software such as your Email, [VPN](/posts/how-vpns-work) and Mobile
communication (texting / calling) all have popular privacy-focused options.

    **Email**
    : Services such as [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) 

    **VPN**
    : ProtonVPN

    **Mobile Communication**
    : Signal, Threema

**Using fake information**
: It's a very common belief that whenever you fill out an online form,
you must give out your correct information. **You dont**.

> For legal documents and other documents that require you to verify your identity, such as government or medical documents, you should put your
correct information in since this will likely need to be verified etc.

Whether it's your social media account, signing up for netflix, creating an account to use an online tool or even ordering doordash, none of these **need** to know your real name or date of birth.

> It's always good to question whether they actually need the information
they are asking for. Does the gaming service actually need to know my real
name?

**Use a post-box**
: When ordering something online, most of us would provide the company
with our credit card details, full name and home address. This can be
avoided by using a parcel locker, or PO box (or similar) where parcels
are sent to, other than your home address. This will save you from
sharing your home address with everyone.

**Paypal**
: Again, this ties in with security, but using paypal where you can is
good practice to keep your data private and secure, since you're not
sharing your credit card details with every single company that you
purchase something online for.
