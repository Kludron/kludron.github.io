We all know what privacy is, and I'm sure you've heard many times over about how much online privacy
matters. This blog post isn't here to convince you to start to care about your privacy... because you 
already do. This is just to help you realise that privacy is something that you already care about and
rely on, but don't realise the extent at which it's being exploited **#online**.

### I have nothing to hide.

Have you ever said anything to a friend that might be offensive if it's taken out of context? Or shared
something with your doctor that you'd rather not have everyone know about? Do you lock your front door,
or have a password on your phone or email account?

If we truly have nothing to hide, then by all means send all of your login details to everything to
my email address [kludron@lukewarmsecurityinfo.com](mailto:kludron@lukewarmsecurityinfo.com) and I'll
read through all of your texts, emails and post what I find online.

The reality is, all of us have somethings we'd rather not share with the entire world. This is why privacy
is important.

### They already know everything anyway.

**They don't**. Even if you've shared every second of your life online, it doesn't mean that you always
have to 




Your information has value, and companies utilise that value to make profit. This is why
companies such as TikTok or Facebook that are free have SO MUCH profit. Because you are the product.


Privacy is .... This post aims to tackle part of this.

"I have nothing to hide" - Why do you close the door when you go to the bathroom? Why do you shut the door when you're getting
changed?

Have you ever said something offensive to anyone as a joke? Take it out of context and it's no longer a joke.

Privacy has value, that's why Facebook and Google earn so much money from their free services - because they sell
their data, and data has value.
