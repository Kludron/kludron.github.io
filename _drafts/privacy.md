Privacy is .... This post aims to tackle part of this.

"I have nothing to hide" - Why do you close the door when you go to the bathroom? Why do you shut the door when you're getting

Privacy has value, that's why Facebook and Google earn so much money from their free services - because they sell
their data, and data has value.
