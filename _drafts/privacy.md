We all know what privacy is, and I'm sure you've heard many times over about how much online privacy
matters. This blog post isn't here to convince you to start to care about your privacy... because you 
already do. This is just to help you realise that privacy is something that you already care about and
rely on, but don't realise the extent at which it's being exploited online.

### I have nothing to hide.

Have you ever said anything to a friend that might be offensive if it's taken out of context? Or shared
something with your doctor that you'd rather not have everyone know about? Do you lock your front door,
or have a password on your phone or email account?

If we truly have nothing to hide, then by all means send all of your login details to everything to
my email address [kludron@lukewarmsecurityinfo.com](mailto:kludron@lukewarmsecurityinfo.com) and I'll
read through all of your texts, emails and post what I find online.

The reality is, all of us have somethings we'd rather not share with the entire world. This is why privacy
is important.

### They already know everything anyway.

**They don't**. Even if you've shared every second of your life online, it doesn't mean that you always
have to 


### How to stay more private online.

**Posting when you get back home**
: This tip ties in with security. When you see someone post an image of them overseas on a holiday, one 
would typically assume that they're overseas on a holiday. But what does that mean for someone with 
potentially malicious intent? You're not at home, and probably won't be for a while.

**Using privacy-focused software**
: Software such as your Email, [VPN](/posts/how-vpns-work) and Mobile
communication (texting / calling) all have popular privacy-focused options.

    **Email**
    : Services such as [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) 

    **VPN**
    : ProtonVPN

    **Mobile Communication**
    : Signal, Threema

**Using fake information**
: It's a very common belief that whenever you fill out an online form,
you must give out your correct information. **You dont**.

> For legal documents and other documents that require you to verify your identity, such as government or medical documents, you should put your
correct information in since this will likely need to be verified etc.
{: .prompt-warning}

Whether it's your social media account, signing up for netflix, creating an account to use an online tool or even ordering doordash, none of these **need** to know your real name or date of birth.

> It's always good to question whether they actually need the information
they are asking for. Does the gaming service actually need to know my real
name? 
{: .prompt-tip}

**Use a post-box**
: When ordering something online, most of us would provide the company
with our credit card details, full name and home address. This can be
avoided by using a parcel locker, or PO box (or similar) where parcels
are sent to, other than your home address. This will save you from
sharing your home address with everyone.

**Paypal**
: Again, this ties in with security, but using paypal where you can is
good practice to keep your data private and secure, since you're not
sharing your credit card details with every single company that you
purchase something online for.

Your information has value, and companies utilise that value to make profit. This is why
companies such as TikTok or Facebook that are free have SO MUCH profit. Because you are the product.


Privacy is .... This post aims to tackle part of this.

"I have nothing to hide" - Why do you close the door when you go to the bathroom? Why do you shut the door when you're getting
changed?

Have you ever said something offensive to anyone as a joke? Take it out of context and it's no longer a joke.

Privacy has value, that's why Facebook and Google earn so much money from their free services - because they sell
their data, and data has value.
