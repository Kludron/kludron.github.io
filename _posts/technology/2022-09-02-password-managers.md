A Password Manager is a tool that is used to keep a copy of all of your passwords.

While a sticky note or your memory might keep track of all of the passwords that you're using, more likely than not, you're reusing the same
passwords more than once, which can pose a **major** security risk to yourself.

Password managers are a simple and secure way of holding all of your passwords, and making sure that all of your accounts are secure online.

## Why should I use a password manager?

##### Easier to manage

The most obvious answer as to why you should use a password manager is that it's easier to manage your passwords... it's in the name. You can view
all of your unique passwords from one place, without having to remember any of them.

##### Securing all of your accounts

One of the major security risks in personal security is the reuse of passwords. The reason for this, is that if that password gets leaked, then every
login with that password is open to being breached.

**My passwords won't be leaked because I keep them in a secure place!**

The majority of times, password leaks are not your fault at all. Most of these happen when a company is hacked and the user passwords 
(or [*password hashes*](/progress)) are released to the public. 

With a password manager (and proper use), however, if the worst-case scenario happens of one of your passwords being leaked, then you'll have
to change just the one site that uses that password.

## What are the best practices of using a password manager?

With all of your passwords being held in one place, we need to make sure that that one place is secure. To do this:
- Make sure that your *master password* is **unique**, **strong** and **not used before**.
- Secure your password manager login with [**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**](/progress).
- Regularly **backup** your passwords. Most password managers have the option of exporting the *database*. Make sure these are offline backups, such
as a USB in a *safe*.

> Make sure that your *Master Password* (the one used to access your password manager) is secure and not used before. Losing this could mean
losing all of your passwords. It's best to write this one down...

To make best use of the password manager and to make sure that you're as secure online as possible:
- Make sure all of your passwords are randomly generated using a combination of **UPPERCASE**, **lowercase**, **numb3rs** and **$ymbols**, as well
as being **at least** 12 characters in length.
- Organise your passwords so that they're easier to find...
