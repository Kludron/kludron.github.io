# Recommended Browsers (for privacy)

These browsers recommended are based on what provides you with the most privacy and security.
These are my personal opinion, and based on my experience with the browsers.

## Tor Browser (The Onion Router)

TOR will always be one of the best browsers to use for privacy. By running everything through tor routes,
it acts as an in-build anonymous (somewhat) VPN, made up of community-driven endpoints.

I'll post another blog on how TOR works, but the tldr of it is that it's a connected network of community,
privacy-focused 'exit nodes' that allow anyone to connect to any website (deepweb and clearnet), 

1. Tor
2. Brave
3. Firefox (with recommended settings)
4. Min
