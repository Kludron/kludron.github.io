The following recommendations are based on **privacy** *(i.e., how much data the browser collects by default)*, **security** (i.e., how often are patched rolled out? what is their historical track record with being hacked etc.) and **user-friendliness** (i.e., how easy would it be to transition over to this browser, how much setting up does it take, is it difficult to use etc.)

With this in mind, the following **desktop browsers** were ranked based on each of those categories (i.e. **privacy, security, user-friendliness**):

- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Brave
- Tor
- Min
- Microsoft Edge
- Internet Explorer
- Safari
- Opera
- Vivaldi

## Recommended Browsers (for privacy)

These browsers recommended are based on what provides you with the most privacy and security.
These are my personal opinion, and based on my experience with the browsers.

### Tor Browser (The Onion Router)

TOR will always be one of the best browsers to use for privacy. By running everything through tor routes,
it acts as an in-build anonymous (somewhat) VPN, made up of community-driven endpoints.

I'll post another blog on how TOR works, but the tldr of it is that it's a connected network of community,
privacy-focused 'exit nodes' that allow anyone to connect to any website (deepweb and clearnet), 

1. Tor
2. Brave
3. Firefox (with recommended settings)
4. Min
