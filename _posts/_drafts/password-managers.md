A Password Manager is a tool that is used to keep a copy of all of your passwords.

While a sticky note or your memory might keep track of all of the passwords that you're using, more likely than not, you're reusing the same
passwords more than once, which can pose a **major** security risk to yourself.

## Why should I use a password manager?

One of the major security risks in personal security is the reuse of passwords. The reason for this, is that if that password gets leaked, then every
login with that password is open to being breached.

**My passwords won't be leaked because I keep them in a secure place!**

The majority of times, password leaks are not your fault at all, most of these happen when a company is hacked and the user passwords are released
to the public.
