# Securing Firefox
While the default settings in most privacy-focused browsers like Firefox provide good protection, there are always some things that we can do to improve it and customise it for our use. First is a guide to a very secure version of Firefox, but might not be super practical for everyday use. Second, is a guide to a more practical version for those where Firefox is the primary browser, but aren’t super focused on their privacy (while still providing good protection).

**Securing Firefox**:

First, we’re going to make sure that we are deliberate in what we’re downloading. To do that go to:

**Settings → General** (or visit ‘about:preferences#general’ in your url).

Then scroll down to **Files and Applications** → Click on ‘Always ask you where to save files’

Next, jump on over to the ‘Search’ tab (on the left hand side) or visit ‘ about:preferences#search’ in your browser. Here, we are going to change the search engine over to DuckDuckGo, who are a well-known, privacy-focused search engine.

**Settings → Search → Default Search Engine** → Change to ‘DuckDuckGo’

Finally, we’re going to jump over to the ‘Privacy & Security’ Settings to adjust some things there. You can access this in the left hand column, or by visiting ‘about:preferences#privacy’ in the URL bar.

**Super-Secure Firefox Settings**:

While in the search settings, scroll down to ‘Search Suggestions’, and unselect ‘Provide search suggestions’.

Next, we are going to (optionally) increase the tracking protection to strict, and disallow password saving, browsing history, dangerous content and HTTP.

To do this, go to:

**Settings → Privacy & Security → Enhanced Tracking Protection**.

For tracking protection, choose ‘**Strict**’, or ‘**Custom**’ and (depending on how secure you’d like to go) choose ‘Cookies from unvisited websites’ which includes blocking cross-site tracking cookies.

Under ‘Send websites a “Do Not Track” signal that you don’t want to be tracked, leave this as ‘Only when firefox is set to block known trackers’.

For ‘**Cookies and Site Data**’, select ‘Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed’.

Under ‘**History**’ select the drop down next to ‘Firefox will’, and choose ‘**Use custom settings for history**’. From here click on ‘Always use private browsing mode’, and you should be prompted with a firefox restart which you should do.

Next, scroll down to ‘Firefox Data Collection and Use’ and deselect all options here. From here, under ‘Security’, ensure that ‘Block dangerous and deceptive content’ and the subsections are all selected, as well as the checkbox under ‘Certificates’ (‘Query OCSP responder servers…’). Finally, scroll down to HTTPS-Only Mode, and ensure that ‘Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows’ is selected.
