# A Brief Look into Ransomware
## What is ransomware?

Most of you would have heard of the word ransom before – typically to pay for the release of a captive or something similar. Ransomware is based off that, in that historically it has been where a hacker releases malware (virus) onto a victims computer, encrypts it and then demands payment of a ransom in order to decrypt the computer.

Unfortunately, as decryption keys have become more available and hackers have learnt from past mistakes, most ransomware now has an added element to increase the pressure. Typically what we see now is that if a ransom isn’t payed within a small time period (usually 24 hours), then the hacker releases publishes the files for the world to see and deletes the decryption key.

While backups would have typically stopped most ransomware attacks previously (in that with a fully encrypted system, you could simply restore to a previous version), there is also the added element of whether your company or business would survive through confidential internal information being shared.

## How do we counter this?

**Backups** are still the best way to stop this. With ransomware being more popular, a lot of ransomware found on personal laptops simply require a decryption key – which becomes irrelevant if you restore from a backup. There are also services such as [**NoMoreRansom’s Crypto Sheriff**](https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php?lang=en) that has a database of ransomware and their decryption keys.

For businesses with confidential information that they’d like to not be shared, **backups** are still vital in order to get your business up and running again, but other security measures such as only giving **permissions** to those who need it when they need it can help limit any damage caused. It’s also important to have a incident response team (external or internal) or some sort of security / consulting plan ready to go if this situation arises in order to be able to determine if it’s a real threat or not. For most businesses, it’s rarely a matter of IF you come under a security breach, but WHEN – which is why it’s important to be prepared.
