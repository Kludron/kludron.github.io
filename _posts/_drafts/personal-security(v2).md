One question that I'm often asked is: "How do I improve my personal security?". Most people have heard of VPN's, using complex passwords
and typically even multi-factor authentication (MFA). While it's good that these are becoming more and more common, and more
people are hearing about them, it can often be confusing on what they are and what is necessary for you... hopefully this will clear some
of that up.
