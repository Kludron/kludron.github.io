## Quick tips to improve personal security.

***TLDR****; Use a password manager such as Bitwarden or 1Password, set up Multi-factor authentication on an app such as Authy or Google Authenticator, and always use a VPN.*

**DON’T REUSE PASSWORDS.**

The concern for personal privacy and security is a growing area of interest and is a topic that is becoming more and more prevalent throughout the world today.

Securing your information has become so simple and easy to do, but has taken time to catch on.

For improving your personal security:

Set up Multi-Factor Authentication.
This can be as simple receiving an email / text whenever you log in to a service to verify that it’s you.
It’s recommended that you use a dedicated authenticator app such as {google authenticator, authy, microsoft authenticator}
Use strong passwords.
What defines a strong password? Based on what current technology, in order to reduce brute force attacks, it’s recommended that the passwords contain:
At least 8 characters in length.
Use random numbers and letters.
Don’t use a word in the dictionary (real words are much easier to crack).
Alternatively, just remember one password (that you haven’t used anywhere else) and use a password manager. This is a really simple, smart and secure solution and it’s usually quicker than remembering a whole bunch of passwords.
Don’t reuse passwords.
This is an important one, and one where using a password manager would solve it.
Use a VPN.
This is important to ensure your connections stay private ESPECIALLY when using insecure wifi such as public wifi. Using a VPN at home can also keep you safe from a virus that could be one someone else’s computer that you don’t know about.
Set up device encryption.
Guides on how to set up device encryption on MacOS (Filevault), Windows (BitLocker) and Linux (LUKS) can all be accessed through the guides section here: https://lukewarmsecurityinfo.com/category/guides-and-walkthroughs/
Install Virus Protection
This is vital in stopping common threats to your devices. From what I’ve found, Bitdefender [https://www.bitdefender.com/] is the top pick at the moment for Windows and Mac in terms of what it can detect. It’s also important that all devices are covered, including your phones.
Most antivirus / endpoint protection software nowadays is reactive, but typically comes with a firewall to block incoming threats as well as scanning software to remove threats already on the system.
It’s important to ensure your software is fully up to date, and running a scan at least once per week.
Kapersky is also a very viable solution, coming up second to Bitdefender in coverage.
Other options include Norton, Avast, Malwarebytes and many others.
For improving your personal privacy:

There has been a recent push for more privacy-focused services which has allowed companies such as Proton (ProtonMail and ProtonVPN) and Brave to release secure, privacy-focused mail services, vpn’s and browser’s. With that in mind, here are some things that you can implement to improve your personal privacy online.

Use a Privacy focused mail provider.
ProtonMail is a easy-to-use, secure and common alternative to popular services such as Gmail or Outlook.
Use a Privacy focused VPN.
ProtonVPN is also a good option here, with access for all devices – it ties in well with your ProtonMail account. Typically, services that don’t collect logs are good bets.
Use a Privacy focused browser.
TOR is always going to be the best browser to use for privacy. It stands for ‘The Onion Router’ and routes all traffic through end nodes – similar to a vpn. Basically, this means that anything you search on here is hard to trace back to you.
Brave is a really good, easy-to-use alternative to Google Chrome (it’s built off the same product [Chromium], meaning that everything transfers over really easily).
Firefox is also a good alternative, but will need to have certain features adjusted to provide good security and privacy features. I have created a guide on how to use this here [Setting up Firefox guide].
Use a Privacy focused Search Engine.
DuckDuckGo and Brave are both common and secure search engines that are privacy focused. While neither of these yet are up to Google’s standards, they are secure, still provide good search results and don’t track your data.
Don’t use Google or Facebook
I know that earlier I mentioned the Google Authenticator app for security and multifactor authentication – while they provide good security and easy-to-use services, it comes at a high price.
Google is very well known for collecting lots of data on it’s users, and not necessarily using it for the right reasons.
Post when you get back, not when you’re there.
When posting pictures and updates on social media, don’t tell the whole world that you’re not at home right now – post when you get back from your holiday.
Use a secure messenger app
This is both for security and privacy reasons, but using an app such as Signal (or other verified end-to-end encrypted communications) or Threema are vital to ensuring that your messages stay between only you and who you intend to send it to.
Even SMS can be snooped on, but apps such as Facebook’s (Meta) Messenger are big no-no’s.
A good rule of thumb is to look at how companies make their money. If you aren’t buying a product, most of the time you are the product. Even Google, who can make their money through advertisements, use their users as the product through ‘personalised ads’.

Recommended Password Managers:
For offline use: KeePassXC [https://keepassxc.org/download/]

Open source options: Bitwarden [https://bitwarden.com/download/]

Other top recommendations: 1Password [https://1password.com/], Dashlane [https://www.dashlane.com/], LastPass [https://www.lastpass.com/]

Some of these, such as KeePassXC and Bitwarden also allow for a multi-factor authentication code to be added.
