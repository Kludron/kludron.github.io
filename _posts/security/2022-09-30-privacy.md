summary: "Privacy is something that we all care about, but when it comes to online privacy we sometimes forget how much we actually care."
---

*Privacy is a complicated thing, and our view on privacy has been tainted by companies that rely
on our lack of desire for privacy*.

We all know what *privacy* is, and I'm sure you've heard many times before *how much online privacy
matters*. This blog post isn't here to convince you to start to care about privacy... because you 
already do. This is just to **help** you realise that privacy is something that you already care about and
rely on but don't realise the extent to which it is exploited **online**.

> This blog is only part of a series and will continue to be updated. Privacy is vital, which has become
even more evident with the recent Optus Breach (*blog coming soon*).

When I speak with others about online privacy, and why it's not much of a concern to them, these are
some of the responses I receive.

### I have nothing to hide.

Have you ever said anything to a friend that might be offensive if it's taken out of context? Or shared
something with your doctor that you'd rather not have everyone know about? Do you lock your front door,
or have a password on your phone or email account?

_No Privacy_

If we truly have nothing to hide, then by all means send all of your login details for all of your accounts
to my email address [kludron@lukewarmsecurityinfo.com](mailto:kludron@lukewarmsecurityinfo.com) and I'll
read through all of your texts, emails and post all that I find online for your friends, family,
neighbours, bosses etc. to see.
After all, if there's nothing to hide, then this wouldn't matter, right?

In reality, all of us have certain things we'd rather not share with the entire world. **This is why privacy
is important**.

> **Privacy** and **Secrets** are not the same. While you might want to keep your secrets private (kind of
core to it being a secret), some things require privacy. **For example**, when you go to your room
to get changed, it's clear that you're getting changed, that's not a secret, but typically you'd want some 
form of privacy with this. It's probably safe to assume that (as fully grown adults) we wouldn't want
to get completely changed infront of our grandparents... right?

### They already know everything anyway.

This, being one of the most common arguments for why not to bother about privacy, is **wrong**. An
important view to have when it comes to companies having your data is **perspective**; if you stopped
sharing everything online today, then in 10 years, their data on you is much less relevant. Even if 90% of 
your life has been shared on social media up to this point, **it doesn't mean that the rest of your
life needs to be shared**.

> Just because you've always eaten sugar, that doesn't mean you **always have** to eat sugar. Similary with
online privacy; just because you've always posted *everything* online, it doesn't mean that you need
to continue to.
{: .prompt-tip}

All in all, online privacy is comparable to "see it to believe it", in that if we can't directly
see the consequences of it, we don't fully comprehend the extent of it. If someone was physically
standing there watching us all the time, then we would (most likely) feel quite uncomfortable
about that, but when it comes to online, most of us are ok with people watching everything
we do there; because we can't physically see them watching us. 

## Recommended Follow-up 

Below is a recording of a TED Talk by **Glenn Greenwalk** titled "Why Privacy Matters". This is a phenomenal talk that looks into why privacy
matters. I'd highly recommend watching this video to learn more about why privacy matters, and how it's something
we already all take into consideration; but just forget about when it comes to being online.
