title: What are Zero-Days?
summary: "*Zero-Day* is a security term that has been in the news quite a bit recently, but what does it mean?"
---

Put simply, a *Zero-Day* (O-Day) is a vulnerability or exploit that has been known to the developer
for *Zero Days*. Essentially, it's a brand new vulnerability.

## Why are these important?

Typically, we see on the news headline something like *Apple patches zero-day vulnerability* or 
something similar. While *technically* these aren't *Zero-Days* since the developer has known
about them (long enough to develop and release a patch), they refer a vulnerability that was once
a *zero-day* implying that it could have been used *actively* in the wild by attackers.

With the implied aspect of a *zero-day* being actively used in the real world on real people, **it's
important that patches for these vulnerabilities are updated as soon as possible**.

> **In the wild** simply refers to outside of testing, such as something being actively exploited in
the real world.

## Zero-Day Vulnerability vs. Zero-Day Exploit

**Vulnerability**
: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities refer to vulnerabilities in the software that can be used by malicious
attackers. These, however, are just vulnerabilities and doesn't necessarily mean that they have
been exploited.

> Vulnerability vs Exploit example: Imagine a door that is really old and rusted and looks like
it could break at any moment. While it's still a door, and still blocks intruders, it would only
take a small kick to break down the door - hence it's a vulnerability to the security of the house.

**Exploit**
: Zero-Day Exploits refer to the actual written exploits for a vulnerability. In a comparison of
the severity of an exploit vs a vulnerability, an exploit is much more critical since the 
vulnerability simply indicates the possibility of an exploit.

## Resources

The [Zero Day Initiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/) keeps a regularly
updated list of the *zero-days* reported to them which can be viewed on the link above. When a
vulnerability is found and reported it (typically) is registered as a *CVE* (Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures) with a format that follows *CVE-YYYY-XXXXX* where *YYYY* is the year, and *XXXXX* is
a unique number (typically the nth vulnerability found that year). These CVE's are listed on
publicly accessible databases such as [this one](https://www.cvedetails.com/index.php) and is 
assigned a severity rating from 0-10.

***I'll post a more detailed blog about CVE's in the future***
