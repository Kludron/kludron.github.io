First of all, if you're still considering whether or not to use a password manager - you should. Check out my blog giving a brief overview of
some of the benefits of using a password manager [here](/posts/password-managers).

#### What to consider

When choosing a password manager, there are some things to consider:
- What are the capabilities? (i.e., MFA Code Generation, Random Password Generation, Generating Backups, Password Sharing etc.)
- What is the support like? (i.e., Is it community-driven? Are there resources online if I get stuck?)
- What are the costs? (Can I trial the software if there is a cost?)
- Personal or Business use?
- What platforms are their apps available on? (i.e., iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, Browser)

**TLDR**
: For those starting out with a password manager, I would suggest trying [**1Password**](#1password). While it is paid, it's quite 
cheap at $2.99 USD/month. It has many user-friendly features such as password recovery and travel mode, and has
lots of online support available if you get stuck.
